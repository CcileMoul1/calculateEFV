Each line of a constraint file represent a constraint.
The symbol are = (equal), <= (lower or equal), >= (greater or equal), < (lower strict), > (greater strict) (for now, the strict symbols are treated as the "or equal" symbols)

On each side of the symbol, the formula is a sum. Each term are separated by a space (or more) or by "spaces + spaces". (+ is optional).For substraction, use a negativ coefficient.
Use a point to separate coefficient from the name of the reaction.
The symbol 1 (one) is optional if it's a coefficient (only if it's positiv. you have to write 1 in -1)
You can have several times the same reaction (or no reaction) in the same side of the symbol (see below)

Examples
1.V1 + -1.V2 = 2.V3 (1)
V1 -1.V2 = 2.V3 (equivalent to (1))
V1 <= -1 (2)
V1 + 1 <= 0 (equivalent to (2))
V1 -1.V2 V2 1 3 -3<= 0 (equivalent to (2))
V2 + V3 + V7 >= 10.V1
